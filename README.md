# Gender-and-age-detection-system
The "Gender and Age Detection" project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict a person's gender (male or female) and estimate their age range based on an image of their face. Using OpenCV for real-time image processing, the project leverages pre-trained models to extract facial features and classify them.
