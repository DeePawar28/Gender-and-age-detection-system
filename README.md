# Gender-and-age-detection-system

## Project Description:

This project aims to implement a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect gender and estimate the age of a person from a facial image. It utilizes OpenCV for real-time face detection and processes input from images or live video feeds. The system classifies gender as either 'Male' or 'Female' and assigns an estimated age range, providing practical applications in domains such as social media, marketing, surveillance, and human-computer interaction.

## Technologies Used:

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
    - OpenCV
    - TensorFlow
    - Caffe Model for age and gender prediction
    - argparse for command-line arguments

## Model Details:

- **Face Detection Model:** Uses OpenCV's pre-trained DNN model.
- **Age Detection Model:** Uses a pre-trained Caffe model that divides age into specific ranges (e.g., 0-2, 25-32, etc.).
- **Gender Detection Model:** Also a Caffe model, classifying individuals as either 'Male' or 'Female'.

## Results:

The model is capable of real-time detection with reasonably high accuracy for both gender and age. Experiments indicate strong performance in controlled environments, though performance may vary with different lighting conditions or occlusions in the image.

## Future Enhancements:

- **Group Detection:** Extend the project to handle group age and gender detection.
- **Accuracy Improvement:** Implement more complex models for higher accuracy.
- **Integration with other datasets:** Explore more datasets to improve the diversity of age ranges and gender balance.
